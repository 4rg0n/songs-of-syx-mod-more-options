# Game Api

Gates to the game code
* 
* Api classes **MUST** be able to grow and change easily
* Api classes **SHOULD** not contain states
* Apis **MAY** break often when game changes
* Api package structure **SHOULD** be thin layered (best one only)
* Mod code **SHOULD** always use Apis to call game code
* Keep it simple stupid!
